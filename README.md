Random fun explorations I've gone through that are not major enough to warrant their own repository.

These are not all of them, but the ones that I think are most valuable AND well-documented by me; also the ones that have been saved over the years since many lie in 
random project files, on old hard drives, and in ill-named ROBLOX projects. 

I hope that the reader will find something useful to them
